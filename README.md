A custom implemenation of my studies in machine learning

Overview:

In my pursuit to create superior NPCs for physics-based VR interactions, I have endeavored to understand neural networks and the techniques to train them from the ground up. 
Inside this project are custom implementations of genetic algorithms, backpropogation, deep learning, and proximal policy optimization. 
My test scenario for my machine learning code was a physically simulated drone in Unityś PhysX(NVIDIA) engine.


Scene description:

-The non-marked scenes are genetic algorithm test cases

-The PPO scenes are PPO test cases

This project laid the foundations of my machine learning knowledge, but I have moved on to using standard tools like PyTorch and Tensorflow in Unity´s ML-Agents for superior performance and learning speed.
